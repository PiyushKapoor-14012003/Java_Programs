/*Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 

Note: Return 1, if there is at least one triplet following the condition else return 0.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists. 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the boolean function findTriplets() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (n) as inputs and print 1 if the function returns true else print 0 if the function returns false. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constrains:
1 <= n <= 104
-106 <= Ai <= 106
 */
/*
 * Approach:
 * For every element of the array check if there is a pair(by using two pointer approach) whose sum is equal to the negative value of that element.
 * Note:- First sort the array so that we can use two pointer approach to find a pair. 
 * Sort the array in ascending order.
 * Traverse the array from start to end.
 * For every index i, create two variables l = i + 1 and r = n â€“ 1 and run a loop until l is less than r
 * Check if the sum of array[i], array[l] and array[r] is equal to zero then return true as we found the triplet.
 * If the sum is less than zero then increment the value of l by 1, by increasing the value of l the sum will increase as the array is sorted, so array[l+1] > array [l]
 * If the sum is greater than zero then decrement the value of r, by decreasing the value of r the sum will decrease as the array is sorted, so array[r-1] < array [r].
 * In the end, if a triplet is not found then return false.
